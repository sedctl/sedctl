## ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS

The **sedctl** project is currently in the very early development state and is not usable yet.

If you're looking to use it, please wait until the the project reaches a somewhat mature state.  
Once it evolves further, the work-in-progress status will be removed.

Thank you for your patience.
